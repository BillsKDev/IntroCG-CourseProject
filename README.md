<h3>Base Game</h3>
This game is a third person puzzle-combat game that is built off from teams GDW game **SCRAP** from Cracked Eggs last year, however I did remove alot of the polish since it was not needed for the prototype. 
In this prototype, the player has to use their magnetic arms to solve a puzzle and then come face to face with an enemy and must defeat it to win the game. The losing condition is if the player is defeated by the enemy.
Since the professor allowed me to use my previous GDW game, I am only using scripts/models from our game without any polish to get an idea of what our game was like, but will create custom shaders and effects for this assignment. <br>

**Note on External sources for base game**

Since this game was made by my team, the models/textures are made by my previous teammates, and since I do not have GDW this year the professor told me I could use my previous GDW game to build this project off of.
The code however, was written by myself and one other team member so i acknowledge that there was another team member working on these systems with me. The **SCRAP** repository can be seen here with all the code changes I made: https://github.com/Cracked-Eggs/ScrapY4
To explain the code from here, We worked on a state machine system over the course of the last year that is used for both the player & enemy and is integrated smoothly with the combat system with every action having a different state. There are also simple scripts for
a door and pressure plate to work with the magnetism mechanic for **SCRAP** where players can use their robot parts to progress through the game. I also acknowledge over the course of last year we probably used AI to help with bug fixing.
